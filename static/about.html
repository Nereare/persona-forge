    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>This application is inspired by <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf
      Fortress</a>’ <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Thoughts_and_preferences">thoughts
      and preferences</a> section, which contains a plethora of information about
      each and every character.</p>

    <p>Inspired by such a level of complexity, I decided to create a default
      format under which one can generate a somewhat equally complex description
      for one’s persona.</p>
